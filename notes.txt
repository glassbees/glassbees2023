Notes

------------------

Design:

- Big backdrop of Envoy panorama and/or Monkeytown

- transparent background Glass Bees signature over big photo

- Captains of Industry character on bottom of some page.

- keep general courier typography look?

- grid of each track's artwork? maybe as background?

- do something more prominent with photo of mom and kid at Places of Death
